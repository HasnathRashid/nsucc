For Nsu Creative Community Web site

We design index page and login registration page.

We are going to use Laravel PHP Framework for Back End

We put our front End Design Inside Laravel Frame work.
resouces->view->welcome.blade.php
resouces->view->auth->login.blade.php
resouces->view->auth->register.blade.php

Any Database is not Connecting with this frame work.
we will use mysql thats why we choose xampp for our localhost.

For Installing laravel we use Composer (PHP dependency)
